<h1>Social-Link</h1>
In this project I needed to make a page for a Brazilian snack bar <br>
to be used as a "link in bio" on a restaurant's Instagram.
<br>
<br>
<h2>The project</h2>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li> <br>
It should contain a button that returns to the Instagram page, <br>
a button that took the user to Facebook and another that took them to their Ifood page.
<br>

<h2>Image</h2>
